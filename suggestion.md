### üîß Prototype Stack with Python

1. **QR Code Scanning**

   * `opencv` + `pyzbar` ‚Üí detect & decode QR codes using camera.
   * Alternative: `qrcode` (for generating test codes).

2. **Face Capture & Matching**
   * `opencv` ‚Üí open webcam & capture photo.
   * `face_recognition` ‚Üí compare captured face with stored encodings (from your ‚Äúcollege DB‚Äù mock).
   * `dlib` (dependency for face\_recognition).

3. **Database (Mocking College DB)**

   * Use **MongoDB** (with `pymongo`).
   * Store:

     * Student ID (linked to QR code),
     * Face embedding (from `face_recognition.face_encodings`),
     * Profile details (name, roll no, etc.).

4. **Attendance Marking**

   * On successful face match:

     * Insert a document in `attendance` collection.
     * Store `student_id`, `timestamp`, and `status`.

5. **Session Management**

   * Simple **timer** with `time.time()` to auto-expire after 30s.
   * Could also maintain a session dictionary with expiry timestamps.

### ‚è≥ Flow in 30 Seconds

1. User scans QR ‚Üí decode student ID.
2. Prompt photo capture ‚Üí run face recognition.
3. If match found ‚Üí fetch details from MongoDB.
4. Insert attendance record with current timeslot.
5. Expire session after 30s (force restart if exceeded).

### ‚úÖ Why This Works for a Hackathon

* You don‚Äôt need to integrate college‚Äôs **real** database yet ‚Üí mock it with a MongoDB collection.
* Everything is **self-contained in Python**.
* Can run locally without cloud infra (unless you want extra polish).
